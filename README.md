For this project, I utilize SQL for data exploration and Tableau for data visualization. The dataset consists of confirmed COVID-19 deaths in Canada and other countries from January 2020 to February 2023. The dataset was downloaded from the following website:
https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths

The answers of the following questions are covered in this project:

1- What is the likelihood of dying in Canada?

2- What percentage of Canada has contracted COVID?

3- Which countries have the highest infection rate compared to their populations?

4- Which countries have the highest death per population?

5- What is the total deaths in Canada?

6- What percentage of the population has received at least one COVID vaccine?

Data visualization which performed by Tableau can be seen here: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/maryam1503/viz/CovidDashboardProject_16773767629120/Dashboard1
